A C# library for communicating with the Monoprice 4 and 6 zone amplifiers

Currently nonfunctional.

Monoprice currently sells a 6 and 4 zone amplifier for whole home audio. These amplifiers are capable of being controlled over RS232 via a simple text based protocol.

This library is an attempt to simply the process of interfacing with these amplifiers by providing a drop in communication interface that is threaded, event driven, and robust.
